    <div class="part1">
I found a love for me<br>
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead<br>
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet<br>
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me<br><br>
</div>


<div class="part11">
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
Not knowin' what it was<br>
I will not give you up this time<br>
But, darlin', just kiss me slow<br>
Your heart is all I own<br>
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part111">
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br>
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part1111">
[Verse 2]<br>
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know<br>
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home<br>
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets<br>
To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
See Ed Sheeran Live<br>
Get tickets as low as $83<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part11111">
[Pre-Chorus]
We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
Fightin' against all odds<br>
I know we'll be alright this time<br>
Darlin', just hold my hand<br>
Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
I see my future in your eyes<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part111111">
[Chorus]<br>
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song<br>
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful<br>
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part1111111">
[Bridge]<br>
No, no, no<br>
Mm, no, no<br><br>
</div>

<div class="part11111111">
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms<br>
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song<br>
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met<br>
An angel in person and she looks perfect<br>
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight<br><br>
</div>
